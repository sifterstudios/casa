In case of fire, there's a couple things to know:

### Fire-ladder
There's a fire ladder from one of the bedrooms in the top floor (left when you come up the stairs), which has a pin in it. If there's a fire, you can exit through there. The window itself has childproofing, so you need to pull the latch towards you (bottom of window) to be able to open the window fully. Luckily, this is pretty hard to do to keep the window safe around kids.

### Fire-extinguisher
There's a standard fire extinguisher located in the laundry room (middle floor).
Pull the pin and aim at the bottom of the flames.
