INTERNET! Yes.
There's a QR-code by the entrance or on the dining table that will get you connected, and SSID and password for our wifi is also there. 
We have pretty good coverage in the whole house, but it's better in the first two floors than in the top floor.
Also, our internet has 500 Mbit upload and download speed, so you should be able to use it without any speed issues.
