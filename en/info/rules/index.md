# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

We have some simple rules that we want tenants to abide by, detailed below:
- The office to the right when you enter, as well as the storage room (next door on the right) is off limits to tenants.
- It is the tenants responibility to ensure the skylights in the upper floor are closed in case of rain. Naturally, damages sustained by water damage will have to be paid by the tenants!
- Please make sure doors are closed when you leave the house, both front and back doors.
