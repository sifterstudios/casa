# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

linje-casa has a large outside terrace where one can sit, play, and have fun in general. **Feel free to use it!**
There's also a garden that's available for your use. 

For now we don't have any borders to our neighbors **(which are very nice, by the way)**,
we've set the border to where the houses start and end, which should leave plenty of space for some minimalistic soccer or botcha games.
