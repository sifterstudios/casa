Depending on *when* you stay at linje-casa, there might be things to consider regarding the weather. 
Here's a short little list:

### Rain
When it rains, it's imperative that you make sure the skylights are closed, or set to the **safe** position. There's a little nub in the frame of the window, and you can insert a bolt into that nub to make sure the window does not open more. This is rain-proof. Alternatively, you can leave the handle of the window open, that will open up the ventilation for the window even if the window itself is closed. It is your responsability to make sure linje-casa doesn't suffer any water damage from open skylights while you live here.

### Drought
If you want, you are very welcome to start the lawn sprinkler once a day if its hot during the summer. This is also fun for kids! :laughing:
The water source is in the small alleyway between linje-casa and the next house!

### Winter
During winter, there will be ice forming on the windows due to condensation forming outside the windows - fret not, this is completely normal and expected from a fairly new house
