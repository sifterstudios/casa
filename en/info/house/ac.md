Ah, the Air Condition system. A beautiful thing. There's a little catch though.
We wanted to utilize the smart system of the unit, and as we found out, there's no way to
both use the app/smart system and the remote at the same time.

So, in order to change the temperature or settings, you could either
log into our [smarthouse](http://homcieassistant:8123), or let us know and we can change the setting from our phone as well.

Information about where to find login-information can be found in the page for [smart-house](../smart/ha.md)
