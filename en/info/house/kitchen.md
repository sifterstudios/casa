The kitchen isn't really something super fancy, so we're confident you'll find out how the appliances work pretty quickly.
Here's some pointers, though!

---

- There's double drawers inside the big drawers. Supposed to look better?
- The cooktop, dishwasher, airfryer and microwave all use touch-controllers for usage. If you're wet on your hands, they might not respond. Dry your hands and try again! :thumbsup:
- There's also a `Stove guard` right under the vent (white rectangular thing), that will start an alarm if it senses too high of a temperature by the cooktop. If you are cooking, touch the only button on the unit to let it now you are there. If you don't do anything the cooktop will turn off, and you will have to touch the same button to get the electricity back again! This is obviously a safety measure so the house doesn't burn down. :fire:
