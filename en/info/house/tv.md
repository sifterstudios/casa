Right. TV.
If you're the person who likes to enjoy [linear-tv](https://www.brid.tv/what-is-linear-tv/), you'll need two remotes, the white one for the TV,
and the black one for the TV decoder. There's a manual for the black TV remote [here](https://www.altibox.no/privat/kundeservice/tv/tv-dekoder/fjernkontroll/) (norwegian only, sadly).

However, for all the rest of your needs you only need the samsung remote (white).

### TV Operation
The TV itself is a Sumsung Frame TV. To get started, click on the :house: on the white remote. There, you'll find apps to open for streaming services.
When you turn off the tv, there will be a picture on the tv. This is expected behavior :white_check_mark:

You are free to access our own streaming services and ask that you **don't** log out of our accounts and into your own, and instead use the user labeled `Airbnb` instead of our own personal ones (unless you are streaming for your kids, then use the `Kids` account).

The streaming services available are:
- Netflix
- Hbo Max

Both show norwegian content only.
