# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

linje-casa has eletronic heaters in every room meant to stay in, and where there's tiles, there's heating in the floor. Cozy!

In addition, during cold weather, you might want to sit by our fireplace and watch the flames devour the wood like the universe devours us little by little.. Erhm. 
Or, just to keep warm.

Anyways, the electronic heaters all have thermostats, so it really shouldn't be necessary to fiddle with them. If you still feel the need to, there's arrow buttons on them; :arrow_heading_up: for **warmer**, and :arrow_heading_down: for **colder**.

Head to the next page for the biggest warmth-inducing object in the house..!
