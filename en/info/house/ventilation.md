# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

There's a ventilation system in the house that is managed by a box in the garage(left side).
Sometimes it turns itself off, so if you're experiencing a little heavy air in the house that can be something to check. We usually just pull the plug and connect it again. Then you can adjust the strength of the ventilation from 1-4 on the touch-display. We usually keep it at 2, and if there's many people in the house, we bump it to 4.
