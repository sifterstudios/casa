At present, we have two robots in the house; a robot-lawnmower and a robot-vacuumer. Both are set to do their thing automatically, but you can circumvent this quite easily if that doesn't fit with your schedule. More info below:

### Robot Lawnmower
The lawnmower is set to cut grass every evening. It's almost silent, and we've chosen this time to mimize the risk of kids playing with it, as its a dangerous device with rotating knives. Once in a while the mower gets stuck in one of the corners of our part of the garden and stays there permanently. We would appreciate if you could carry the mower over to its charging station by the terrace if that happens, as well as:
- Push the big STOP sign to reset it
- Push the :house: button on the mover, followed by the :white_check_mark:. This will make it try to find its way back home to the charging station (note, in this mode the blades won't turn so it's harmless)
Keeping in mind that the mower starts to cut in the evenings, we would appreciate keeping in mind clutter laying on the grass to minimize damage to both the mower and the clutter! :wink:

### Robot vacuumer
Our vacuumer, aptly named `Dusty`, usually starts its round of cleaning at around noon. If that doesn't fit or isn't necessary, push the :house: icon on it to make it return to its charging station. If you don't want it to do anything at all, it's possible to turn it off entirely with a on-off switch on the side of the device, however we ask nicely that you turn it on again before you leave linje-casa!
