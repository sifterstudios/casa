Normal bathrooms, not much to report here. If you'd like to take a bath in the bathroom @Ground floor, there's a mechanism to switch between the showerhead and the faucet. You switch between these by turning the faucet itself. When the faucet faces the short wall, the showerhead will supply water, and if the faucet faces the tub, it will supply water instead. That's one of our most asked question when we have guests over! :laughing:
