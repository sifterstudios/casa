# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

In Oslo, there's three different types of garbage; 
- Plastic: Goes in a purple bag
- Food: Goes in a green bag
- The rest: Goes in a normal shopping bag

All of these are located under the sink in the kitchen.

We also have spaces for Glass&Metal, Bottles that kan be handed in at the store (pant), and Cardboard/Paper.
All of *these* are located in the laundry room, under **that** sink
