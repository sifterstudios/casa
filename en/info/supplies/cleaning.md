# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

If you've spilled something and need to clean it up, what you need will be in the laundry room.

You're free to use the washing machine and/or tumbler, they're pretty simple to operate. We usually use the 'Daglig vask' option and choose the temperature by clicking the thermometer button.

For the tumbler, we turn the switch on step to the right, and then turn it on. After use, empty the water container and **clean out the filter!**
