When you are about to leave us, please make sure of the following:
- Empty the garbage cans in the house, info on this [here](../supplies/garbage)
- Make sure the doors to the garden and terrace in all floors are locked
- Roof-windows in the top floor should either be closed or open to the maximum [safe](../house/weather) angle.

::: tip How was your stay?
We'd love to learn how to get better, and get honest feedback. The best way for you to do that after your stay is to leave a review from the email you will get from Airbnb or by logging in to airbnb and checking your profile.
Anything missing from this online guide? You can also let us know about that [directly](../contact/contact).
