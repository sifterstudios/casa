# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

When arriving at our house, you will have gotten a unique code for the main door of the house, that has a smart lock. Now, suffice to say, this code is created for your arrival and will be deleted after you have left, but still, it's important to keep the code safe, as anyone with the code can gain entry to the house. To make your stay easier, you can also choose to use the RFID-chips that you'll find inside the house. These are very simple to use, as detailed below.

## Usage
#### Code
Touch the display lightly so it lights up
Enter the code, and end with #. Example: 123456#
The display now should light up green, and you can open the door. It will lock itself when the door is closed!
#### Chip
Touch the display lightly to it lights up
Hold the chip by the keypad
The display now should light up green, and you can open the door. It will lock itself when the door is closed!
::: danger NB!

There's always a possibility of forgetting both the chips and the code. We have a solution in place for this, but seeing as we (understandably) don't want this info open on the internet, this will have to go through us.
